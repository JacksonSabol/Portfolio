                <p>My name is Jackson Sabol, and I am a Full-Stack Web Developer based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I primarily focus on front-end development, but I'm comfortable with back-end work as well, using technologies and libraries like React, Node, Express, MySQL, and MongoDB. Before I became a web developer, I worked as a conservation biologist for various consulting firms across the western United States. Over the years, Iâ€™ve been responsible for collecting, analyzing, and presenting large amounts of invaluable data on the progress of restoration projects. The management of biological data is what got me interested in programming!</p>
